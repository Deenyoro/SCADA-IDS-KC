# SCADA-IDS-KC Repository Organization

**Date:** July 21, 2025  
**Action:** Repository cleanup and organization  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## 📋 Cleanup Summary

The SCADA-IDS-KC repository has been comprehensively cleaned up and organized for better maintainability, clarity, and professional structure.

---

## 🔄 Files Moved and Organized

### ✅ Test Files Relocated
**From Root → `tests/`**
- `test_gui_functionality.py` → `tests/test_gui_functionality_manual.py`
- `test_gui_monitoring.py` → `tests/test_gui_monitoring_manual.py`

**Reason**: Consolidate all test files in the dedicated tests directory to avoid confusion and maintain clean separation.

### ✅ Documentation Files Relocated
**From Root → `docs/`**
- `CLAUDE.md` → `docs/CLAUDE.md`
- `DEFINITIVE_PACKET_CAPTURE_PROOF.md` → `docs/DEFINITIVE_PACKET_CAPTURE_PROOF.md`
- `FINAL_TESTING_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` → `docs/FINAL_TESTING_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`

**Reason**: Centralize all documentation in the docs directory for better organization and discoverability.

### ✅ Build Scripts Organized
**From Root → `scripts/`** (New Directory)
- `build_docker.sh` → `scripts/build_docker.sh`
- `build_linux.sh` → `scripts/build_linux.sh`
- `build_windows.bat` → `scripts/build_windows.bat`
- `build_windows.ps1` → `scripts/build_windows.ps1`
- `build_windows.sh` → `scripts/build_windows.sh`

**Reason**: Group all build-related scripts in a dedicated directory for easier maintenance and execution.

### ✅ Setup Scripts Organized
**From Root → `scripts/`**
- `setup_dev.py` → `scripts/setup_dev.py`
- `setup_windows_deps.ps1` → `scripts/setup_windows_deps.ps1`
- `setup_wine_python.sh` → `scripts/setup_wine_python.sh`

**Reason**: Consolidate development environment setup scripts with other utility scripts.

### ✅ Utility Scripts Organized
**From Root → `scripts/`**
- `generate_network_traffic.ps1` → `scripts/generate_network_traffic.ps1`

**Reason**: Keep utility scripts organized with other development tools.

### ✅ Configuration Files Organized
**From Root → `config/backups/`**
- `SIKC.cfg.backup` → `config/backups/SIKC.cfg.backup`

**Reason**: Move backup configuration files to the appropriate backup directory.

### ✅ Packaging Files Organized
**From Root → `packaging/`**
- `SCADA-IDS-KC.spec` → `packaging/SCADA-IDS-KC-main.spec`

**Reason**: Consolidate PyInstaller specification files in the packaging directory (renamed to avoid conflicts).

### ✅ Docker Files Organized
**From Root → `docker/`** (New Directory)
- `Dockerfile.windows-build` → `docker/Dockerfile.windows-build`
- `docker-compose.yml` → `docker/docker-compose.yml`

**Reason**: Create dedicated directory for Docker-related configuration files.

### ✅ Cache Cleanup
**Removed**
- `__pycache__/` directory and contents

**Reason**: Remove generated cache files that should not be in version control.
