## üöÄ **DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Recommended Use Cases**
1. **Security Operations Centers (SOCs)** - Use GUI mode for real-time monitoring
2. **SCADA System Administrators** - Use GUI for daily monitoring tasks
3. **Automated Security Systems** - Use CLI mode for scripted monitoring
4. **Training Environments** - Use GUI mode for demonstrations and training
5. **Production Networks** - Deploy both modes as needed

### **Deployment Considerations**
- **Administrator Privileges:** Required for network packet capture
- **Network Interface Access:** Ensure proper interface permissions
- **Log Storage:** Plan for log file storage and rotation
- **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor system resources during operation

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MINOR CONSIDERATIONS**

### **Non-Critical Items**
1. **Notification Libraries:** win10toast/plyer not available in executable (alternative notifications work)
2. **System Tray Icon:** Icon file missing but functionality works correctly
3. **Administrator Requirements:** Standard requirement for network monitoring tools

### **Impact Assessment**
- **No impact on core functionality** - All SCADA IDS capabilities work perfectly
- **Workarounds available** - Alternative notification methods function correctly
- **Expected behavior** - Administrator privileges are standard for network tools
