            ## SCADA-IDS-KC Standalone (No Bundled Npcap)

            This release requires Npcap to be installed separately on your system.

            ### Features:
            - Smaller executable size
            - Uses system-installed Npcap or Wireshark
            - Comprehensive system diagnostics
            - Fallback detection for existing installations

            ### Requirements:
            - Npcap installed separately (download from https://npcap.com/)
            - OR Wireshark installed (includes Npcap)

            ### Usage:
            1. Install Npcap or Wireshark first
            2. Download `SCADA-IDS-KC-standalone.exe`
            3. Run as Administrator

            ### When to Use:
            - You already have Npcap/Wireshark installed
            - You prefer manual control over packet capture drivers
            - You want a smaller executable file
