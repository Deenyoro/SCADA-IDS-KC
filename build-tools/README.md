# Build Tools Directory

This directory contains additional build utilities and helper tools for the SCADA-IDS-KC build system.

## Purpose

The build-tools directory is designed to house:
- Build system utilities and helpers
- Custom PyInstaller hooks
- Build validation scripts
- Deployment automation tools
- Build environment setup utilities

## Current Status

This directory is currently empty but reserved for future build system enhancements.

## Planned Tools

### Build Validation
- **`validate_build.py`** - Comprehensive build validation script
- **`test_executable.py`** - Automated executable testing
- **`check_dependencies.py`** - Dependency verification tool

### PyInstaller Enhancements
- **`hooks/`** - Custom PyInstaller hooks for complex dependencies
- **`spec_generator.py`** - Dynamic spec file generation
- **`optimize_build.py`** - Build optimization utilities

### Deployment Tools
- **`package_release.py`** - Release packaging automation
- **`sign_executable.py`** - Code signing utilities
- **`create_installer.py`** - Windows installer creation

### Environment Setup
- **`setup_build_env.py`** - Build environment configuration
- **`install_build_deps.py`** - Build dependency installer
- **`verify_system.py`** - System requirements checker

## Integration Points

### With Build Scripts
Build tools will integrate with the main build scripts:
- Called automatically during build process
- Provide additional validation and optimization
- Enhance error reporting and diagnostics

### With CI/CD
Tools will support GitHub Actions workflows:
- Automated testing and validation
- Build artifact processing
- Release automation

### With Development Workflow
Tools will assist developers:
- Local build environment setup
- Build troubleshooting
- Performance optimization

## Usage Patterns

### Validation Tools
```bash
# Validate build environment
python build-tools/validate_build.py

# Test built executable
python build-tools/test_executable.py dist/SCADA-IDS-KC.exe

# Check dependencies
python build-tools/check_dependencies.py
```

### Optimization Tools
```bash
# Optimize build configuration
python build-tools/optimize_build.py

# Generate optimized spec file
python build-tools/spec_generator.py --optimize

# Analyze build size
python build-tools/analyze_size.py dist/SCADA-IDS-KC.exe
```

### Deployment Tools
```bash
# Package for release
python build-tools/package_release.py

# Sign executable
python build-tools/sign_executable.py dist/SCADA-IDS-KC.exe

# Create installer
python build-tools/create_installer.py
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tools
When adding tools to this directory:
1. Follow consistent naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive help and documentation
3. Integrate with existing build scripts
4. Test on multiple environments
5. Update this README

### Tool Requirements
All tools should:
- Support command-line usage
- Provide clear error messages
- Include progress reporting
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Be compatible with CI/CD environments

### Integration Standards
Tools should integrate with:
- Main build scripts (PowerShell and Python)
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Local development environments
- Error reporting systems

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Automated Testing Suite** - Comprehensive executable testing
2. **Build Optimization** - Size and performance optimization
3. **Code Signing** - Automated executable signing
4. **Installer Creation** - Windows installer generation
5. **Deployment Automation** - Release and distribution tools

### Integration Opportunities
1. **IDE Integration** - Visual Studio Code tasks
2. **Docker Support** - Containerized build tools
3. **Cross-Platform** - Linux and macOS build support
4. **Cloud Integration** - Cloud-based build services
