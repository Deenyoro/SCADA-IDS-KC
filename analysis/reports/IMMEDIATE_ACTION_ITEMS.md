# SCADA-IDS-KC Immediate Action Items

**Date:** July 20, 2025  
**Priority:** HIGH - Address before production deployment  

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED DURING REVIEW

### 1. ML Model Status Display Bug - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Issue:** main.py was looking for `"is_loaded"` but ML detector returns `"loaded"`  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Files Modified:** 
- `main.py` lines 288-292: Changed `ml_info.get('is_loaded', False)` to `ml_info.get('loaded', False)`
- `main.py` lines 376-380: Changed `info.get('is_loaded', False)` to `info.get('loaded', False)`

**Verification:** ML model status now displays correctly in CLI

## üî¥ CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

### 2. File Permission Security Issues
**Issue:** Critical files have overly permissive permissions  
**Risk Level:** HIGH - Potential security vulnerability  
**Status:** ‚ùå NEEDS MANUAL FIX  

**Affected Files:**
- `src/scada_ids/settings.py` - Currently 666, should be 644
- `src/scada_ids/security.py` - Currently 666, should be 644  
- `models/` directory - Currently 777, should be 755
- `logs/` directory - Currently 777, should be 755

**Manual Fix Required (Windows):**
```powershell
# Run these commands in PowerShell as Administrator
icacls "src\scada_ids\settings.py" /inheritance:r /grant:r "Users:R" "Administrators:F"
icacls "src\scada_ids\security.py" /inheritance:r /grant:r "Users:R" "Administrators:F"
icacls "models" /inheritance:r /grant:r "Users:RX" "Administrators:F"
icacls "logs" /inheritance:r /grant:r "Users:RX" "Administrators:F"
```

**Linux/Mac Fix:**
```bash
chmod 644 src/scada_ids/settings.py src/scada_ids/security.py
chmod 755 models/ logs/
```

## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - NEXT 2 WEEKS

### 3. Configuration Management Gap
**Issue:** CLI has 15 configuration features vs GUI's 3 features  
**Impact:** Feature disparity between interfaces  
**Status:** ‚ùå NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION  

**Solution:** Create comprehensive configuration dialog for GUI

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create `ui/dialogs/config_dialog.py`
2. Add configuration tabs:
   - Detection settings (threshold, model paths)
   - Network settings (interface, BPF filters)
   - Logging settings (level, file paths)
   - Notification settings
3. Add "Settings" menu item to main window
4. Implement save/load configuration functionality

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### 4. Code Documentation Improvement
**Issue:** Only 6.6% comment ratio (target: >10%)  
**Impact:** Maintainability concerns  
**Status:** ‚ùå NEEDS IMPROVEMENT  

**Action Items:**
- Add docstrings to all public methods (priority: controller, ML detector, GUI)
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms
- Document configuration options
- Create API documentation

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week

## üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - NEXT MONTH

### 5. Code Quality Improvements
**Issue:** 463 magic numbers, 13 print statements detected  
**Impact:** Code maintainability  
**Status:** ‚ùå NEEDS CLEANUP  

**Action Items:**
- Extract magic numbers to constants file
- Replace print statements with proper logging
- Address 1 bare except block found
- Refactor 4 large classes (>20 methods)

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

### 6. Enhanced Error Recovery
**Issue:** Limited error recovery mechanisms detected  
**Impact:** System resilience  
**Status:** ‚ùå NEEDS ENHANCEMENT  

**Action Items:**
- Implement circuit breaker pattern
- Add retry logic for network operations
- Enhance graceful degradation mechanisms
- Add automated error rate monitoring

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week
